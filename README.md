## Setup furhat and run code
To run the python code on the furhat, first boot up Furhat Studio and click the button "Start remote API"

After this you should be able to run the python file like usual. From the terminal this is:
```
python furhat.py
```

To make the Furhat follow the closest virtual user, open the web interface (https://localhost:8080) and go to the 'wizard' tab. There you can add virtual users by double clicking the picture with the Furhat.
